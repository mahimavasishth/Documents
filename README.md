I am a Ph.D. candidate in the Economics Department at the University of California, Irvine.

My research interests are in the fields of Labor Economics, Development Economics, and Public Economics. I am particularly interested in understanding the factors that shape women's economic outcomes.

I will be available for interviews during the 2022-2023 job market.
